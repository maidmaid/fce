## Defining Relative Clause

RL is necessary.

- The woman who lives next door is a doctor.

> Don't use comma. Can use THAT.

## Non-Defining Relative Clause

RL is extra information.

- My brother Craig is a baker. (He lives in NSW.)
- My brother Craig, who lives in NSW, is a baker.

> Use commas. Don't use THAT.

## Reducing

### Rule 1

If the **antecedent** is the **subject** of the RC, you **cannot** reduce it.

> The "Boardroom" is **a shop** `which sells second hand surfboards`.

### Rule 2

If the **antecedent** is the **object** of the RL, we **can** remove the relative pronoun.

> **The man** `whom I spoke to yesterday was French`.

> :arrow_right: **The man** `I spoke to yesterday was French`.

### Rule 3

If the **relative pronoun** if followed by a **"be" verb**, you **can** remove the relative pronoun and the be verb.

> **The little girl** `who is wearing a pink dress` is my daughter.

> :arrow_right: **The little girl** `wearing a pink dress` is my daughter.

What we are left with is a **participle phrase**. Participle phrases can be moved around in the sentence.

> `Wearing a pink dress`, the little girl is my daughter.

> The little girl is my daughter, `wearing a pink dress`.
