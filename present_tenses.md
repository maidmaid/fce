# In our modern society, many people work far way from their home and they have to move thanks to the transports. Many ask themselves which is the best transport option. Among them, the two most usual solutions are using its own car and using the public transport.

At first, let us talk about the public transport. It has been proved that the public transport generated less pollution than the car. Indeed, if we divide the quantity of gas emission by the number of people, a bus is seen as more ecological than a car. Moreover, most of the trams and trains are electric now. Secondly, when a person is subject to do some long drive, it is cheaper to use the public transport. Indeed, in this situation, we could benefit from special reduced price, especially for the elderly and students whereas with the car, more we are driving, more we are spending money. Last but not least, the public transport are now really quite distributed, especially in the big town; thus, it is possible to head for where we want.

There is also a lot to say about the car. At first, the modern cars has a very low consummation of fuel, so some of them are entirely electric and they literally generate no pollution; however, this kind of car has an expensive buying price. Secondly, always thanks to the modern technology, the new car are fuel efficient. Thus, compared with an old car and for a same distance of drive, we save the environment and our money. Last but not least, the flexibility brought by the car is a significant advantage. Thus, there is no constraint of time to go where you want because you do not depend of any timetable.

In conclusion, in my opinion, it is simply impossible to say that one of theses solutions is better than the other because they answer to different needs: public transport is probably better for the long drives, whereas the car would be more interesting for the people looking for flexibility.
