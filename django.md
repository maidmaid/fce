'Django Unchained' is one of the most fascinating western movie that I have never seen. It stars Jamie Foxx in the role of Django Freeman and Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz. It is directed by the talented Quentin Tarantino.

The film is set in the 18th century in Texas, in the slavery period. Django and Dr. King Schultz start together a collaboration in some different purposes. Indeed, Schultz is a bounty hunter and is looking for arrested the Brittle brothers, death or alive, whereas Django wants to find her wife Broomhilda von Shaft, from whom he has been separated because of the slave trade. The plot, which focuses on the adventures of these two main characters, can be shocking for some sensitive people. For instance, a lot of shooting scenes are performed and which show some bloodshed sequences. Obviously, a movie without bloodshed sequences would not be a movie of Quentin Tarantino. However, the storyline is really captivating.

A special secondary characters is casted by Leonardo DiCaprio himself as Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. It is an important character, because Monsieur Calvin is the enemy of the story and he does not hesitate to use the violence. The performance of DiCaprio in this role is absolutely awesome.

I would recommend the film to anyone who like western. This movie will surprise you by his way of treating with humor a subject with a serious basis.
