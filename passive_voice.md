# Passive Voice

- Active: Cats `eat` mice.
- Passive: Mice `are eaten` by cats.

> "be" + p.p. (+ by + agent (doer))

Why passive? Changes the focus to "mice".

- Active (inventors): Edison `invented` the light bulb.
- Passive (inventions): The light bulb `was invented` by Edison.

When the agent is not important (1) or is unknown (2).

1. 3 people `have been arrested`.
2. My car `has been stolen`!

Very common in news reports and scientific writing.

Must be a transitive (or di-transitive) verb.
