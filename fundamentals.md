# Grammar Fundamentals

English in as `S V (O)` language.

- `S` subject
- `V` finite verb
- `O` Object

## Clause

Subject + Final verb = Clause

- Independent (makes sens on its own): _I drink beer_.
- Dependent (cannot stand alone): _because it is delicious_.

Every sentence in English must have at least one independent clause.

## Finit verb

What is a finit verb?

- I **eat** pizza.
- I **ate** pizza yesterday.
- I **eating** pizza yesterday. NOT a finite verb.

## Auxiliary verbs

Auxiliary verbs: be/do/have

## Modal verbs

Modal verbs: will/would/can/should/shall/...

## Phrase

It's a group a words that does not have a subject and a finite verb.

Eg:

- The expensive red car.
- Reading books.
- On the table.
- to send the letter.
- is playing tennis.

# Transitive, Intransitive and Distransitive Verbs

Transitive verbs must have a **direct object** (= noun).

Eg:

- He told **me** to go away.
- I ate **shushi**.

Instransitive verbs do not have direct objects, but can have indirect objects (prep + noun).

Eg:

- He arrived **at 9:00**.
- She talked **to me**.
- He goes **to work every day**.

Ditransitive Verbs have both a direct and indirect object.

Eg:

- I will give `some flovers` `to my wife`.
  - `some flovers` is the **direct** object.
  - `to my wife` is the **indirect** object.

## Link Verbs

Link verbs don't have an object. They link the subject to a noun or an adjective. (complement)

Eg:

- She is lovely. (adj. compl.)
- She is my teacher. (n. compl.)
- she looks beautiful.
- She sounds nice.
- she seems lovely.
- It smeels delicious.
- It tastes wonderful.

## Simple sentences

SV (o): I like surfing.
SVV: I ran and jumped.
SSV: Bill and Mary hugged.
SSVV: Bill and Mary hugged and kissed.
