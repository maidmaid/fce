I have been at Hard Rock Cafe last week for the dinner, and I think that it is one of the best restaurants in Surfers Paradise.

The surrounding is intentionally old-fashion. The ground, the tables, the chairs, the bar... All is done in wooden. There are also some original decorations, like vintage motorbikes exposed like in a museum, or some surf boards hooked on the wall. The only negative point could be the volume of the music which is too much loud. Furthermore, the waiters were welcoming and helpful.

I have gone there with my best friend and as usual, we have ordered some spicy food. More precisely, we took chilly chicken (with a spicy level of 2 on 3) with some chips. We were very satisfied by the quantity and the quality of our dish. Moreover, when you order spicy food, you have unlimited soda. The price looks a little bit expensive, but in my opinion, when I go in a restaurant and (almost) all is a faultless, I totally agree to pay a little bit more.

Although the prices are not the most competitive that you could find in Surfers Paradise, I highly recommend this restaurant.
