# Conditionals

A conditional has 2 clauses and describes a situation ("if" clause) and a result (result clause).

The "if" clause is dependent and the result clause is independent.

## 0 conditional

If + S + Present Simple, S + Present Simple.

Use
- Facts
- You can also use past simple or past continuous.
  > I always went to the beach on Saturdays if the weather was good.

  > If it was raining, I stayed home.

## First conditional

> If it is sunny tomorrow, I will go surfing.

> If it rains, I will take an umbrella.

If + S + Present Simple, S + Will (can) + Base Verb

- Imaginary past
- Often used to express regret

## Mixed conditionals

Sometimes a past situation has a present result.

Max didn't study very hard (past situation, 3rd, if clause). Now he cannot go to university (present result, 2nd, result clause).

:arrow_right: If Max had studied hard, he could go to university now.

Sometimes a current situation (habit/routine) affects the past.

Thomas doesn't come to school often (present situation, habit/routine, 2nd, if clause). He didn't pass the exam (past result, 3rd, result).

:arrow_right: If Thomas came to school more often, he would have passed the exam.

## Others ways

### Unless (If + not)

- If you do not shut up, I will kill you !
- :arrow_right: **Unless** you shut up, I will kill you!


- If I had not sat next to you, we wouldn't be friends.
- :arrow_right: **Unless** I had sat next to you, we wouldn't be friends.

### Only if

The situation must happen ("if") to get the result (will/would etc).

- Only if you study hard, will you (inversion) pass.
- Only if you go, will I go.

### Same as "Only if" but no inversion.

As long as .. provided that .. on the condition that

As long as .. providing that .. on the provision that

- Provided that you pay me back, I will lend you $20.

### If you should/happen to

- If you should have any questions, please do no not hesitate to ask.

Reduced : Should you have any questions, please ask.

### If it was not for = The situation changed the outcome.

- If it was not for your help, I wouldn't have passed the exam.

### If it had not been for

- If it had not been for you help, I wouldn't have finished on time.
